<p><u>Hello Stats App, Help Version 3.1</u></p>
<p>Although this App is simple to learn by itself, the following help pages 
describe each and every feature offered by this App.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Functionality offered</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="auto-style1">This App can be used to perform Statistical calculations 
on an android device where this App is installed. The inputs for various 
statistical calculations can be provided within the App itself, and the results 
are displayed immediately within the App. The input data needed by the App, can 
also be provided from comma-delimited data specified in text files. In a way, this App serves as a portable 
statistical calculator augmenting the standard calculator available within 
android devices.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><em>The App currently provides the users, the ability to do following statistical 
calculations:</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Arithmetic, Geometric and Harmonic means</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Median</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4) Average deviation</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5) Standard deviation</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6) 
Coefficient of correlation, and equation of least-squares regression line</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><em>Supported number formats:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style1">While providing numeric inputs to this application, both 
integers (e.g 5) and numbers with decimal point (e.g. 5.5) are supported. 
Likewise, results are calculated and displayed with high precision using decimal 
point. For certain input data set, results are possible like NaN (Not a number) 
meaning that the statistics result was not possible for the given input data 
set; these results are shown to user as [Err].</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><em>Storing / viewing previous results:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style1">The App via a user setting, allows to store / retain 
previous calculations done within the App. This functionality will help users, 
who need to look at the calculations they have done in the past may be spanning 
the session(s) before the current one, done few days ago or want the 
calculations to be retained when their android device reboots. This feature displays the 
previously stored results as a list. When the user clicks on any item in the 
displayed list, the complete details of that calculation are displayed to the 
user.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><em>Emailing the previous results:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style1">This features is an extension of the "Storing / viewing previous 
results" feature. With a data connection active on the device, the user can 
email to a desired email address all the previous calculations stored 
within the App. The user will receive a text file attachment at the email 
address, of the calculations stored within the App. This features is helpful, 
when the user is about to clear the previously stored calculations within the 
App and can email the calculations before clearing them, or simply wants to retain the calculations at a point in time before doing 
more calculations. This email widget is enabled only when at least one 
calculation is present within the App within the previously stored results. Otherwise, 
the email widget is disabled.</p>
<p class="auto-style1"><em>Application settings:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style1">The App provides a UI for the user to specify certain 
configuration settings. Presently following settings are supported:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">1) Enable persistence : By clicking a check box, the user 
can enable / disable persistence of calculation results. Using this option, the 
calculations done by the user can be stored permanently on their 
android devices. The user also gets the ability to delete stored calculations at 
any time.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">2) Email address : The user can provide an 
email address in a text field, to be saved within the app which the user can 
also remove / modify at any time. 
When the user wishes to have an email sent containing the previously 
stored calculations, the email is sent at the address specified in this 
application setting.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">3) File input preference : By using this setting, the app 
will reset the UI at certain places (as a convenience to the user) to be able to 
easily open a file browser for selecting a text file from the android device. 
This option affects the UI at following locations:</p>
<p class="auto-style1">a) On the UI to calculate "Mean / Median / Mode / Avg 
Deviation / Std Deviation" (navigable from the app home 
page), the option "Select a text file from the device file system" becomes the 
default selection, when the check box for this setting is set to the 'on' state.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">b) On the UI to calculate "Correlation and Regression" 
(navigable from the app home page), the "Select Text File" button is enabled and 
the other buttons get disabled, when the check box for this setting is set to 
the 'on' state.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">4) Standard deviation data set size : The choices for this 
are the actual size of the data set, or "the data set size - 1". The application 
keeps a default as "the actual size of the data set". Please see, the 'standard 
deviation<em>' </em>section of Statistics Fundamentals later in this help, 
for more information about this setting.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">5) Result precision : By using this setting, numeric 
results can be displayed and stored with desired number of decimal places. If 
this setting is not used or a default precision is selected in this setting, the 
app will use the system determined decimal precision.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">6) Least-squares regression equation : By using this 
setting, information about equation of least-squares regression line is also 
displayed along with coefficient of correlation.</p>
<p class="auto-style1">7) Display size for input text boxes : By using this 
setting the user can dynamically resize input text boxes, with sizes referred to 
as small, medium and large. Large / medium sized text boxes are helpful to input 
large numbers or a longer list of numbers.</p>

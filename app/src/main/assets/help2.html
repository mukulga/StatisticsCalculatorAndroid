<p><u class="auto-style4">Hello Stats App, Help Version 3.1</u></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>App Navigation</strong></li>
</ul>

<p class="auto-style2">This section 
describes, how to reach to important functionalities present within the App and 
how to use them. Certain features, which are obvious to understand by simply 
looking at the UI are not described here.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>Application Settings:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The following screen illustrations from the App, show how 
application settings are specified.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="272" src="settings_icon.jpg" width="413" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="248" src="app_settings1.jpg" width="388" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The following screen appears and allows the user to input 
an email address, when the "Email address" application settings is clicked.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="463" src="app_settings2.jpg" width="395" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>Previous Results:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The following screen illustrations from the App, show how 
the user can work with the previously stored results.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="116" src="prev_results1.jpg" width="408" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="266" src="prev_results2.jpg" width="406" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="165" src="prev_results3.jpg" width="409" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If there are no previous results available in the App, 
both the "Clear Previous" and the "send email icon" are disabled as shown in the 
picture above.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">When at least one previous result is available in the 
App, the user would see a screen something like below.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="257" src="prev_results4.jpg" width="392" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">When the user clicks on any calculation in the previous 
results list, the calculation's full details are displayed to the user as shown 
in the picture below.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="470" src="prev_results5.jpg" width="416" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em><a name="modeOfInput">The mode of data input, for calculating mean / 
median / mode / avg deviation / std deviation / coeff of skewness:</a></em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">For these statistical calculations, two modes (i.e how 
the user can provide data input to the application) of data input are provided 
to user as shown in the picture below from the app.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<img height="162" src="data_input_mode.jpg" width="327" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">a) The 1st option can be used to input data from the 
Android device keyboard. It is suitable when, the number of values to which 
statistical calculations need to be done are less.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">b) The 2nd option allows the user to input data using a 
text file (in an encoding like utf-8 or ascii) from the Android device file 
system. At present, the files stored on external SD cards are not supported, and 
the file needs to be kept on the Android device's native file system. On some 
Android devices, the files kept on an SD card may be usable by this feature, but 
this has not been tested and is unsupported. The data in text file for this 
purpose, needs to have numeric values mentioned as comma-separated in a simple 
linear fashion. An example of this kind of data input in the file would be: 
2,3.5,82,100,50. This option is provided to allow the users, to conveniently 
provide relatively large amounts of data to the app, that is otherwise difficult 
to do so from an Android device keyboard. The text files used by this app, for 
example may be created in a text edior for Android devices. They may also be 
created on conventional devices like laptops or desktops, and then copied to 
Android devices. </p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>Similarly, for the Coefficient of Correlation 
calculations input data can be provided from the Android device keyboard or via 
a file. The following picture from the app illustrates this.</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<img height="377" src="data_input_mode2.jpg" width="383" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The text file for this purpose, need to be formatted as 
(a1,b1)(a2,b2)(a3,b3)...(). Where, a1, b1 etc are numeric values. In this 
example, a1 &amp; b1 are values of two variables specified for one entity, a2 &amp; b2 are values for the same two variables for another 
entity and so on. Arbitrary whitespace characters are accepted in the file, 
other than where numbers are specified.</p>
<p class="auto-style6">Note about the reading from files:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The input information can be multi-line in the file 
(which can be convenient for large set of numbers), along with a simple case for 
the input to be on one line.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Arbitrary whitespace characters (i.e " ", \n, \r, \t) are 
optionally accepted in the input file (e.g between comma and a digit, before the 
first visible character in the file, after the last visible character in the 
file, between '(' and a number etc), which will be discarded before the App does calculations on the input.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>Sending Email:</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The user can ask the App to send an email to a specified 
address (specified in Application settings), containing the list of calculations 
stored within the App. The following screen shows, how to request the App to 
send this email.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><img height="252" src="email_icon.jpg" width="405" /></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The App will automatically compose an email, prepare an 
attachment with the details and sends the email to the user.</p>

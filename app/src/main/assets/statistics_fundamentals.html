<p class="auto-style2"><u>Hello Stats App, Help Version 3.1</u></p>
<p class="auto-style4"><strong>Statistics Fundamentals</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style2">This section describes various statistical mathematical 
concepts, that are implemented in the "Hello Stats" app. It is intended to give 
a quick overview of statistics theory, to users who would like to refresh these 
concepts before making use of this app for any serious use.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>(1) Average or Measures of Central Tendency</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>a) Arithmetic Mean</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If x1,x2,x3, ...... xn are n numbers, then their 
arithmetic mean is defined by:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">(x1 + x2 + x3 + ..... + xn) / n</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>b) Geometric Mean</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If x1,x2,x3, ...... xn are n numbers, then their 
geometric mean is defined by:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">pow ((x1 * x2 * x3 ...... ), 1/n)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.e 
the result of multiplying all the numbers, and then finding the nth root of it. 
In this formula, "pow" refers to a power value calculation.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>c) Harmonic Mean</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">If x1,x2,x3, ...... xn are n numbers, then their harmonic 
mean H is defined by:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">1/H = (1/n) * (1/x1 + 1/x2 + 1/x3 ...... 1/xn)</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>d) Median</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Let there be n numbers. To find the median of these given 
set of numbers, the following procedure is followed:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">- Arrange the numbers in ascending or descending order of 
magnitude.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">- When the total number of the items is odd and equal to 
say n, then the value of (1/2) * (n + 1) th item gives the median.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">- When the total number of the items is even and equal to 
say n, then there are two middle items, and the mean of the values of n/2 th and 
(n/2 + 1) th items is the median.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>e) Mode</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Mode is that value in sample data which 
occurs most frequently. It is possible to have more than one such value in the 
sample.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>f) Average Deviation</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">This is defined as the mean of the absolute values of the 
deviations of a given set of numbers from their arithmetic mean.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Let x1,x2,x3 ..... xn be a set of numbers with 
frequencies f1,f2,f3 ..... fn respectively. If x is the arithmetic mean of the numbers 
x1,x2,x3 .... xn&nbsp;&nbsp; then, Average deviation is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">(f1* |x1 - x| + f2* |x2 - x| + ....... fn* |xn - x|) / 
(f1 + f2 + ...... fn)</p>
<p class="auto-style2">It is also correct to think of this calculation, without 
considering the concept of the "frequency" of occurrence of values. If x1,x2,x3 
..... xn are 
a set of numbers (a specific number can occur any number of times in such a set. 
the total number of occurrences of a number, is actually the frequency of that 
number) with x as arithmetic mean, then the 
Average deviation of these set of numbers is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">(|x1 - x| + |x2 - x| + ...... |xn - x|) / (x1 + x2 + 
..... + xn)</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>g) Standard Deviation</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The standard deviation of a set of values x1,x2,x3 ..... 
xn is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Let <em>m </em>be the arithmetic mean of these set of 
numbers. The variance of these numbers is defined as follows:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">VAR. = (1/n) * [(x1 - m)*(x1 - m) + (x2 - m)*(x2 - m) + 
....... (xn - m)*(xn - m)]</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Statistics theorists have different opinions about, that 
what size of the data list must be considered when using this formula to calculate variance 
and therefore standard deviation. Popular beliefs are, that in the 
above formula we can either have 1 / (n - 1) or 1 / n and the rest of formula 
remains same.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The standard deviation (SD) is square root of VAR.&nbsp; 
i.e&nbsp; SD = sqrt(VAR.)</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>(2) Skewness</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Skewness denotes the opposite of symmetry. In a 
symmetrical series the arithmetic mean, the median and the mode are identical. 
Skewness is defined by the following formula:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">(Mean - Mode) / (standard deviation)</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><strong>(3) Correlation and regression</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Whenever two variables are related in a way, that an 
increase in value of the one causes an increase or decrease in the value of 
other, then the variables are said to be correlated.</p>
<p>There are various methods in statistics for finding the correlation between 
two variables. The Hello Stats app implements the Pearson's coefficient of 
correlation, which is defined as follows:</p>
<p>Let <em>m1</em> and <em>m2</em> be arithmetic means of two sets of numbers 
x1,x2,x3 .....&nbsp; and&nbsp; y1,y2,y3 ..... respectively. Then coefficient of 
correlation is defined as following:</p>
<p>Let P = (x1 - m1)*(y1 - m2) + (x2 - m1)*(y2 - m2) + ...... + (xn - m1)*(yn - 
m2)</p>
<p>F = (x1 - m1)*(x1 - m1) + (x2 - m1)*(x2 - m1) + ...... (xn - m1)*(xn - m1)</p>
<p>G = (y1 - m2)*(y1 - m2) + (y2 - m2)*(y2 - m2) + ...... (yn - m2)*(yn - m2)</p>
<p>Coefficient of correlation = P / sqrt(F * G)</p>
<p>A related concept with coefficient of correlation is, equation of a 
regression line. There is a type of regression line (a straight line on an x-y 
axis) termed as "least-squares regression line", whose equation is defined as 
follows:</p>
<p>y = a + bx</p>
<p>where b = r * (Sy/Sx)</p>
<p>a = Ym - b*Xm</p>
<p>Where r = coefficient of correlation, Sx = standard deviation of X values, Sy 
= standard deviation of Y values, Xm = arithmetic mean of X values, Ym = 
arithmetic mean of Y values.</p>

<p class="auto-style1">Terms and conditions of use</p>
<p class="auto-style3"><em>Last modified: 09/12/2016</em></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The following paragraphs describe the terms and conditions 
of use with which 
this app's developer would like to make this app available to the users. These 
points are described below:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">1. This app is provided free to the users. You can use 
this app both for personal and professional use.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">2. Most importantly, this app is created with a desire to 
implement statistical formulas for Android devices. Therefore, from the point-of-view of this app's developer, statistics 
is the most important aspect of this app. Therefore if you have a 
statistics problem to solve whose formulas are implemented by this app, then you 
should use this app.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">3. Every effort has been made by the app's developer in 
the right spirit, to learn the basics of statistical formulas that are 
implemented by this app. Sufficient testing on lot of sample data was done, 
before releasing each version of this app. It can be reasonably claimed by this app's 
developer that all the statistical formulas implemented by this app, are indeed 
implemented correctly as their meaning in the statistics theories.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">4. This app has a feature to provide a text file 
as input containing data for doing statistical calculations. This is likely a 
useful feature, since it can enable a user to input large amounts of data to 
this app. But this feature must be used considering the following facts:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">Please be aware of the amount of free RAM (i.e the 
volatile memory in Android device), your Android device is having at the time you want to use this feature. 
This can be determined by one of various utilities for Android. For e.g., an 
android phone may be having a total RAM of 1GB out of which 375MB is free at the 
moment when this feature is used. This state of the phone is suitable to provide 
really large amounts of data to the app. This app developer's imagination is, 
that this can be of the order of at-least few thousand input numbers and the app 
must be able to handle this without disallowing necessary ram to other Android applications running on the phone.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">5. This app is provided "as is" and any 
implied or express warranties, and fitness for a particular purpose are 
disclaimed. You may test the features of this app by providing small sets 
of data to it and verifying the results, before trusting this app for your 
actual statistics needs.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">6. This app is developed as a solution concept to 
illustrate advanced statistics use on Android devices and to serve users for the 
same. Your Android device and your use of it must be such that, you conciously 
use your android device as a portable computing device and install third-party 
apps on it frequently. This app also does not 
attempt to encourage users from stop using conventional computing devices (like 
laptops / desktops) for doing statistics in any way, and instead use Android devices 
for the same.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">7. Use of third party software libraries:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The third party smtp relay service has been used, to 
implement sending of emails from the App. It was neccessary to use this concept 
(rather than using the gmail client on an Android device), since using the 
Android gmail client will set the "from" field of an email as the email address 
of the Android device owner. Using an smtp relay service as has been used, 
allows the "from" field of an email as the email address 'of' the App (i.e to 
tell the user, that the email came from the App).</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><em>Please use your device's back button now to use this 
app</em>.</p>
